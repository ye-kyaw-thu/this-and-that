Welcome to the Bayesian Guessing Game!
The computer has picked a number between 1 and 100.
After each guess, you'll see a graph showing the current belief about your guess.
The X-axis is the number and the Y-axis shows how likely the computer thinks that number is the correct one based on your previous guesses.
Let's start the game!
