# Explanation of Finite Difference

Finite differences are a method used in calculus, and specifically in numerical analysis, to approximate derivatives. The idea is to calculate the difference between the values of a function at two points, and use this difference to approximate the derivative of the function.

In a more general sense, the finite difference of a sequence of numbers is a new sequence where each element is the difference between consecutive elements in the original sequence. This is often used in numerical methods to approximate solutions to differential equations or in the generation of numerical tables.

For a function f(x), we can calculate the first order finite difference as f(x + h) - f(x), where h is a small increment. The limit as h approaches 0 of this quantity is the derivative of the function f at point x.

For example, for the function f(x) = x^2, the first order finite differences (when h = 1) would be (4-1), (9-4), (16-9), etc., or 3, 5, 7, etc. The second order finite differences would be the differences between these numbers, or (5-3), (7-5), etc., or 2, 2, etc. The second order finite differences are constant because the derivative of x^2 is 2x, a linear function.

Now, let's talk about how this relates to Babbage's Difference Engine.

The Difference Engine was designed by Charles Babbage in the 19th century as a mechanical calculator that could compute values of polynomial functions. It was specifically designed to calculate numerical tables of values, such as logarithmic or trigonometric tables, which were crucial for scientific and engineering calculations of the time.

The operation of the Difference Engine was based on the principle of finite differences, which allowed it to perform calculations using only simple addition. This was a significant advantage because addition is much simpler to implement mechanically than multiplication or division.

The basic operation of the Difference Engine involved setting up a series of "registers" with the initial values of the function and its finite differences. Then, the engine would repeatedly perform the operation of adding the last finite difference to the last value of the function, and updating the finite differences accordingly. This allowed it to compute the values of the function for a sequence of x values.

One important thing to note is that the Difference Engine was capable of handling polynomials of any degree. It would simply need more registers to hold the higher order finite differences. This made it a very versatile tool for its time.
